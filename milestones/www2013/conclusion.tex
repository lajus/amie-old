In this paper, we have presented an approach for mining Horn rules on large RDF knowledge bases. We have introduced a formal model for rule mining under the Open World Assumption, a novel measure to simulate counter-examples, and a scalable algorithm for the mining. 
In contrast to state-of-the-art approaches, our system (AMIE) requires no input other than the KB, and does not need configurations or parameter tuning.
As our extensive experiments have shown, AMIE runs on millions of facts in only a few minutes and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches not only in terms of runtime, but also in terms of the number and quality of the output rules. Our confidence measure can reasonably predict the precision of the rules.
In our future work, we plan to consider also the T-Box of the KB in order to produce more precise rules. We also aim to explore the synergies when several rules predict the same fact, and extend the set of rules beyond Horn rules, so that even more complex facts and hidden knowledge can be predicted.\\[-0.5cm]
