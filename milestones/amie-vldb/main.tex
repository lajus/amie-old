%This article is an extended version of our WWW paper on rule mining in ontological knowledge bases~\cite{amie}.
%We revised the paper throughout and included several new results and  experiments.
This article is based on our previous work~\cite{amie} on rule mining in ontological knowledge bases that we published at the WWW conference 2013 and was awarded 
the best student paper award. The work presented in this article extends the basic approach in several ways and includes new results and experiments.

The original WWW paper introduced AMIE, a system for rule mining under incomplete evidence in ontological knowledge bases (KBs).
Although AMIE was able to successfully mine rules from KBs (such as YAGO2~\cite{yago2}) for which other state-of-the-art ILP systems fail, it was still unable to run in acceptable time over very large KBs (such as YAGO2s~\cite{yago2s} and DBpedia 3.8~\cite{dbpedia}).

%In this article, we present additionally AMIE+. AMIE+ (Sec.~\ref{sec:improvements}) introduces a series of runtime improvements over AMIE.
In this article, we present AMIE+, an approach that introduces a series of improvements over AMIE (Sec.~\ref{sec:improvements}).
We describe sophisticated query rewriting, pruning, upper bounds on the rule confidence, and confidence score approximations, which help AMIE+ explore the search space more efficiently.
%takes advantage of the maximum rule length to prune the search space, makes use of query rewriting and caching when possible,
%and avoids the execution of expensive queries for less promising rules by the use of a confidence upper bound and confidence approximation.
Our experimental results show that AMIE+ provides a huge speedup over AMIE while producing comparable results.
In addition, we conducted a qualitative evaluation (Sec.~\ref{pcaEvaluation}) in order to investigate the basic assumption of AMIE, the Partial Completeness Assumption. %Assumption (PCA), leads to unsatisfactory results.
%We report our findings and suggest possible solutions that strengthen AMIE's performance even when PCA behaves suboptimal.
% Fabian: Let's not emphasize problems early on...
We also re-organized the paper, added more background on alternative approaches,  and improved the overall presentation.

\begin{abstract}
Recent advances in information extraction have led to huge knowledge bases (KBs), which capture knowledge in a ma\-chine-readable format.
Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) can be used to mine logical rules from these KBs, such as ``If two persons are married, then they (usually) live in the same city''.
While ILP is a mature field, mining logical rules from KBs is difficult, because KBs implement the open world assumption.
This means that absent information cannot be taken as counterexamples.
AMIE~\cite{amie} shows how rules can be mined effectively from KBs even in the absence of counterexamples.
In this paper, we show how this mining process can be optimized to support even on large-scale KBs with more than 12M statements -- in a matter of hours instead of days.
Extensive experiments show how our new approach, AMIE+, extends to areas of mining that were previously beyond reach.
